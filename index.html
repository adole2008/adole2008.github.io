Hello World

<h1> Date: 9/1/24 </h1>
<p> I forgot everything about web dev so I'll have to relearn everything at some point and beautify this site. But until then, hello! This is the very first entry in my blog, so welcome. I've actually always wanted to start a blog, but I never ended up doing it - but random 12 am motivation just hit so I decided to give it a shot. Let's see how this goes!

I'll be updating this everyday with something that I learned, something I did, or something I experienced. Recently I watched a video on the "power of compounding": not just the monetary kind, but the fact that if you work on getting just 1% better at something everyday, by the end of a year, you will be a whopping 36x better at that thing. But to be sure, you've got to work on it everyday. So I guess that is my blog entry factoid for today: compounding and its benefits in a world where everyone thinks linearly. To implement compounding in my own life, I'll write a little blog entry and update mysite a lil bit every day: just 1% better. And we'll see how much better this blog really is in one year, shall we?

I must confess, I'm quite excited. That's why I'm starting a bunch of sentences, which I know you're not supposed to do...but this is creative writing after all :)

see you in the next one ;)
p.s: i'm using vim to edit this html entry - i'll try to get 1% better at using vim every day as i write this blog, lets hope i become a vim poweruser in a year :D
